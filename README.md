# Group 105 IDP Software

Arduino Uno Wifi Rev 2 code for "The Thing" including test programs for testing motors, servos, movement commands, line following and block detection.

To do:
- [x] Test motors, servos, line sensors
- [x] Motion commands with serial control
- [x] Line following algorithm
- [x] Perfect 180s
- [ ] Push button / serial command + time delay to start program
- [ ] Call functions from .cpp and .h files
- [ ] Write block detection code
- [ ] Write block identification code
- [ ] Write servo actuation code
- [ ] Write first pass program including block detection, identification and collection
- [ ] Introduce decision-based LED signals and movement LED
- [ ] Write second pass code (similar to first pass)
- [ ] Write third pass search, store, fetch algorithm
- [ ] Switch-case structure?
